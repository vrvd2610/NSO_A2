This NSO assignment 2. 
This repo contains an ansible playbook file (site.yaml) along with HAproxy file (haproxy.cfg.j2) and hosts file. 
This ansible playbook (site.yaml) updates and upgrades the all the web servers and deploy the required modules/extensions and run the flask app in them.
HAProxy file (haproxy.cfg.j2) is a template file used by HAProxy, a widely-used open-source software that provides high availability, load balancing, 
and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications. 
The .j2 extension typically signifies that it's a Jinja2 template file, which allows code dynamically generates HAProxy server entries based on the hosts defined 
in the Ansible group 'web_servers'. 
It ensures that HAProxy will be configured to route traffic to each host in the 'web_servers' group by their hostname and IPv4 address.
